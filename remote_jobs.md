# Remote jobs on midway3 — status and handbook

Snapshot: **2026-09-01 CDT**. Written so a fresh session can pick up cold. Everything needed to
connect, check health correctly, and react to a failure is here. Job state below is live; superseded jobs
are not listed, only summarised in §8 where they carry a lesson.

---

## 0. Connect first (needs a Duo push on the user's phone)

Key-based auth is NOT enabled on midway3; password + Duo is the only method. The ControlMaster socket
expires roughly hourly, so expect to redo this most sessions.

```bash
ssh -S ~/.ssh/cm-mdw3.sock -O check yinhanw@midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu   # alive?
expect /Users/yinhan/Documents/upside2-md/scratchpad/mdw3_master.exp    # if not: opens socket, USER MUST APPROVE DUO
ssh -S ~/.ssh/cm-mdw3.sock yinhanw@midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu '<command>'
```

`~/project` is a symlink to `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/` (note: **yinhan**, not yinhanw).
Load the python env on the cluster with `source ~/project/NP-1AO6/env.sh` before any h5py work.

Snapshot **2026-09-01 CDT**.

### midway2 (broadwl, 28 replicas, T 0.70–0.90) — primary REMD data source

| JobID | Name | Cluster | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 48890657 | `mdw2_glpG-RKRK-79HIS` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1; 74% done; ROLLBACK 4 |
| 48890658 | `mdw2_glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1; 88% done; ROLLBACK 5; **active NaN in replica 27** |
| 48890659 | `mdw2_glpG-RKRK-79ALA` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1; 45% done; ROLLBACK 10 |
| 48890660 | `mdw2_glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1; 96% done; ROLLBACK 5 |

**Binary fix 2026-08-30**: GCC's `-ffast-math` implies `-ffinite-math-only`, which makes `isfinite()` always return `true`, silently breaking the NaN cascade fix. Added `-fno-finite-math-only` to `src/CMakeLists_Other.txt` line 14. Rebuilt binary (midway2 job 48890656). Previous runs (48889671–74) cancelled and data cleared. TM4 stability confirmed from run.0 T=0.70: G136 φ=−113°±9°, 96.5% helical.

Data: `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2/<variant>/`. Logs: `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2/logs/remd.<V>.<jobid>.out`. Self-submitting via `bash submit_remd.sh $V`.

### midway3 (caslake, 48 replicas)

| JobID | Name | Campaign | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 56105311 | `popg_glpG-RKRK-79HIS` | **POPE/POPG** | RUNNING midway3-0213 | block 2; started 2026-09-01 |

**sbatch fixed 2026-08-31.** RCC resolved the slurmctld spool issue. NP job self-submitted successfully as 56565841. REMD jobs will chain normally once they start. Tmux session `remd_popg` on midway3-login1 may still hold srun processes for REMD jobs from the workaround period — verify before relaunching if jobs start and immediately fail. REMD logs: `~/project/popepopg_REMD/logs/remd.srun.<V>.<jobid>.out`.

**REMD local bypass completed 2026-08-28/29.** Jobs 55758021-24 had been PENDING (Priority queue) since 2026-08-27. Cancelled all 4. Ran block 1 locally on Mac M1 Pro (finished 2026-08-29 ~02:12 EDT); extracted last-frame positions (~10 MB); uploaded and reconstructed 48 × 4 minimal `.up` files on cluster with `cluster_setup.py`. All 192 replica files verified 48/48 per variant with `block_count=1`.

**REMD clean restart 2026-08-27.** Cancelled pending jobs 55118057/55119260/55122401/55122658. Deleted wrong-map trajectory data (57-76 chunks generated with biased G136 Ramachandran map, ~228 GB freed). Reset `block_count` to 0 in all 4 variant dirs. Fresh REMD jobs 55758021-24 will reinitialize 48 replicas from `seeds/` at startup; seeds were patched correctly on 2026-08-21 with the original stride-4 code.


**CRITICAL — post-fix trajectories do NOT reproduce the paper's claims.** Block-2 measurement (2026-08-19, 18 246 frames, 3.2% adsorbed-and-compact):

| Paper claim (Carlson et al.) | Post-fix block 2 | Status |
|---|---|---|
| K190 is the most protected site (water + TES common site) | 0.000 contact — lowest of all 58 Lys | **CONTRADICTS paper** |
| K525 protected (water) | 0.000 contact | Contradicts paper |
| K541 protected (TES) | 0.033 contact | Contradicts paper |
| K12, K73 also protected | 0.000, 0.005 | Contradicts paper |
| "Opens and exposes its center" | Dominant patch: Lys313/Glu311/Asp314/Asp562/Lys560 (max 0.33) | Inconsistent |

Rg reaches 230.9 Å (run.3, block 3) — well past the paper's DPD-simulation range. No `np_footprint.npz` exists yet for the current block-3 trajectories (~231k frames/run). None of the paper's five target lysines are contacted; the footprint must be rerun after block 3 completes before drawing any updated conclusions.

**NaN cascade fix** is deployed in the running binary (`src/main.cpp:~517`, added `!isfinite(lboltz_diff)` to exchange rejection). **GLY Ramachandran stride bug** fixed 2026-08-27 (stride-4 restored, all 192 active replica maps patched). Both are in the current deployed binary; no action needed.

**Verify real dynamics after any stage-label or seed change:** internal CA RMSD (Kabsch-superposed) should grow across frames. A frozen protein gives 0.000–0.001 Å; a live one reaches 1.4 Å within 100 frames. Reading `current_stage` is not sufficient — measure the RMSD.

**`HDX_LIVE=1` is mandatory while the REMD jobs run.** `run_remd.py` renames `output` to the lowest free
`output_previous_<n>` at every chunk, so the live group can vanish between being listed and being read; the
flag makes `martini_remd_concat.py` skip it, at a cost of ~200 of 5043 frames.

### The rigid-protein bug — fixed 2026-08-17, keep the lesson (findings 116)

`/input/stage_parameters.current_stage` was **`production_handoff`** in the four seeds, and
`martini_hybrid.cpp:637-641` holds the protein as a rigid group whenever `preprod_protein_mode == rigid_body`
**and** the stage is not exactly `production`. Both were true, so 28–30 h × 4 ran with a frozen protein:
internal CA RMSD **0.000 Å** across whole chunks, H-bond count constant to ±0.01, identical at every rung.

**Fixed.** `set_stage_label(seed, "production")` on all four (backups at `seeds/<V>.up.bak_production_handoff`),
verified `production` / `production` / `rigid_body`, relaunched as 53441123–26.

**The lesson, which is why this stays here.** The 2026-08-15 note declaring these jobs healthy checked
`hybrid_interface_active_stage` (lines 644-648), which *does* accept `production_handoff`. That is a different
predicate on the same string with the opposite accept set. One string, two gates. Reading a gate is not
verification — measure the protein's internal CA RMSD instead.


**Confirmed loading on the new binary 2026-08-15 00:53**: all four reached `[remd] block 1/12` and
`calibration 2000 steps x 48` with `n_atom 4949`, no `expected 1 arguments but got 2`. The seed migration
held.

**These four were verified rather than resubmitted (2026-08-15).** The BB proxy now reads its backbone O
from `infer_H_O`, so `martini_hybrid_position` takes two arguments and every config written by the older
prep fails to load. Checked, in order: `env.sh` points `UPSIDE_HOME` at the rebuilt
`~/beagle3/yinhan/upside2-md`; the four seeds were upgraded in place with
`py/martini_upgrade_hybrid_args.py` and one was proved to load and run on the new binary; the variant
directories are empty, so `run_remd.py` materialises replicas from those upgraded seeds and there are no
stale copies and no `STOP` files; the seeds carry an `/output`, which the first-block `reseed()` requires;
their stage is `production_handoff`, which `martini_hybrid.cpp:646-647` treats as active, so the SC-env
interface is on — **this line is the error findings 116 corrected; that gate is not the one that decides
whether the protein moves.** The 36 h `REMD_WALL_SEC` equals the Slurm limit but the chunk loop guards with
`remaining() - MARGIN > last_wall*1.25` (35 min plus a chunk), so the chain still has room to reseed and
resubmit. **No resubmission needed.**

The NP job cannot be patched the same way — it holds its six replicas open for the whole block — so
`np_prod.sbatch` now runs the same upgrade in the gap before `upside` reopens them. **Confirmed working
2026-08-15 00:25**: the block rolled over to 53372760, all six reported `upgraded`, and the block then
loaded every config under the new binary. That line is a one-shot migration — delete it once a block
reports "already upgraded".

**Reading a `.up` that a running job owns.** `run_np_prod.py` reseeds by renaming `output` to the lowest
free `output_previous_<n>`, so on a live file that group can vanish between being listed and being read;
a first footprint attempt died on exactly that (`KeyError: object 'output' doesn't exist`). Rotated blocks
are never renamed again, so an analysis should read only `output_previous_*` and skip the live group —
that costs ~1.4% of frames and removes the race. Set `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE` to open at all, and
never let `upside_engine` touch a live file: it opens read-write.

Launcher `popepopg_REMD/{submit_remd.sh,remd.sbatch,run_remd.py,env.sh}`, seeds in `popepopg_REMD/seeds/`,
logs `popepopg_REMD/logs/remd.<jobid>.out`, data `popepopg_REMD/<variant>/`. Seeds are the stage-7.0
checkpoints from `popepopg_glpG/<variant>/checkpoints/`: 4709 atoms (1050 protein / 3393 lipid = 261×13 /
266 ions), box 99.869² × 123.697 Å, 7.48 M pairs, ions regenerated at 0.15 M with
`--membrane-thickness-angstrom 42.75`. This copy of `run_remd.py` uses a **per-chunk RNG seed**; the DDM
copy passes a constant one, which is what made its rollback re-run the identical failing chunk.

Seeds: stage-7.0 checkpoints from `popepopg_glpG/<variant>/checkpoints/`: 4709 atoms (1050 protein / 3393 lipid / 266 ions), box 99.869² × 123.697 Å. `run_remd.py` uses a **per-chunk RNG seed** (DDM copy used constant seed → rollback re-ran the identical failing chunk; now fixed).

## 2. THE TWO CAMPAIGNS ARE DIFFERENT SIMULATIONS

Conflating them caused several errors this session, including a threshold copied from NP that killed a
healthy 6 h glpG block. **Never transfer settings, thresholds, or analysis between them.**

| | **NP** (`np_1AO6_prod`) | **glpG** (`remd_glpG-*`) |
|---|---|---|
| method | regular MD, 6 independent trajectories, single T=0.8647, no exchange | **REMD**, 48 replicas, T ladder 0.70–0.90, configuration exchange |
| purpose | nanoparticle adsorption footprinting (K190 exposure) | **HDX** protection factors / ΔG |
| system | 1AO6 albumin 578 res + 5 nm MPA-AuNP, 8608 atoms, box 300 Å | glpG 210 res in a DDM micelle, 3156 atoms, box 137 Å |
| composition | PROTEIN 2890 + GOLD 887 + MPA 203 + ION 4628 (K+ 2423 / Cl- 2205, 0.15 M KCl) | PROTEIN 1050 + LIPID 1674 + ION 432 |
| integrator | **pure velocity-Verlet**, no `/input/brownian` | **MIXED**: 2736 atoms (ION+LIPID+630 protein) overdamped **Brownian**; 420 protein atoms velocity-Verlet |
| timestep | **0.001**, freely settable at runtime | **0.009, HARD-LOCKED** by `/input/brownian/numerical_time_step`; `martini_brownian.cpp:100` throws on mismatch. Friction is tuned against it for lipid D=11.5 µm²/s — **do not change it** |
| detection | non-finite positions OR ≥5 stretched bonds | non-finite potential (whole chunk) OR ≥5 stretched bonds |

---

## 3. NP campaign — `np_1AO6_prod`

**Unfolding is the expected result, not a failure.** 1AO6 albumin spreads on the MPA-AuNP surface. Rising Rg (currently up to 230.9 Å on run.3, block 3) is the intended observable and must **not** be reported as a blow-up. Judge health on non-finite frames, peptide C–N bonds, and `avg_kinetic_energy/1.5kT`. (Contrast glpG, where Rg ~19 Å is the health signal.)

**Dir** `~/project/NP-1AO6/` — `prod/` holds `np.run.{0..5}.up` + `np.<jobid>.out`, `block_count`. **Current configs are the envfull+300Å rebuild** (protein-protein terms injected, 4628 ions at 0.15 M KCl, 8608 atoms); block_count reset to 0.
**Driver** `run_np_prod.py` · **sbatch** `np_prod.sbatch` (sets `NP_DT=0.001`) · **submit** `submit_np.sh`
**Footprint analysis** `np_footprint.py` → `np_footprint.npz` (must be run; no current npz for block-3 data).
**Orientation map** (cardinal Euler faces; see `scratchpad/NP-footprinting/orientation_map.txt`):

```
np.run.0 = 0-0-0   (yaw=0.0,  pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.1 = 90-0-0  (yaw=90.0, pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.2 = 180-0-0 (yaw=180.0,pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.3 = 270-0-0 (yaw=270.0,pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.4 = 0-90-0  (yaw=0.0,  pitch=90.0, roll=0)
np.run.5 = 0-270-0 (yaw=0.0,  pitch=270.0,roll=0)
```

Self-resubmits up to `NP_MAX_BLOCKS=8`; chunks ~104 time units, ~1765 t.u. per 36 h block.
Local build source: `scratchpad/NP-footprinting/` (`build_all.py`, `np_hybrid.py`, six face dirs).

**Status check:**
```bash
f=$(ls -t ~/project/NP-1AO6/prod/np.*.out | head -1)   # newest block log
grep "^\[np\]" $f | tail -20          # driver trace + per-chunk bond counts
grep -ic nan $f                        # expect 0
```

## 4. glpG campaign — `remd_glpG-*` (HDX)

**Dir** `~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/` — one subdir per variant, each with 48 `*.run.N.up`,
`remd.<jobid>.out`, `block_count`.
**NOTE the directory name**: `glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD`. The older `glpG_DDM_REMD` (lamellar, 72 G) is gone.
**Driver** `run_remd.py` · **sbatch** `remd.sbatch` · **submit** `submit_remd.sh <variant>`
**Variants:** `glpG-RKRK-79HIS`, `glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T`, `glpG-RKRK-79ALA`, `glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T`

Config: 48 replicas, T 0.70–0.90, `REMD_DT=0.009`, `--replica-interval 0.09`, `--exchange-criterion 0`,
swap sets A=(0-1,2-3,…) B=(1-2,3-4,…), 300 frames/chunk, `REMD_MAX_BLOCKS=12`.

### HDX analysis for the POPE/POPG campaign — RUNNING (submitted 2026-09-01)

Jobs 57033313–57033316, reading from midway2 block-1 data (`popepopg_REMD_mdw2/`, ~7000–7400 frames/replica, `HDX_LIVE=1`). Outputs land in `popepopg_REMD_mdw2/<variant>/hdx/`. Plot: `results/<V>_POPEPOPG_dG_vs_residue.png`.

To resubmit after more data:
```bash
B=/home/yinhanw/project/popepopg_REMD; MDW2=/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2
for V in glpG-RKRK-79HIS glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T glpG-RKRK-79ALA glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T; do
  sbatch --job-name=hdx_${V} --output=$B/logs/hdx.%j.out --partition=caslake --account=pi-trsosnic \
    --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=16 --time=04:00:00 \
    --export=ALL,PDB_ID=${V},HDX_SRC=${MDW2}/${V},HDX_LIVE=1,HDX_WORK=${MDW2}/${V}/hdx \
    $B/hdx_cluster.sbatch
done
```

It runs `py/martini_remd_concat.py` first — **required**, because the chained driver rotates `output` to
`output_previous_<n>` every chunk, so `/output` alone is just the last ~300 frames. The concat joins the
chunks in restart order, renumbers `time`, and drops whole any chunk with a non-finite potential (a
rolled-back chunk is not a sample). Verified against a 3-chunk file: boundary frames in place, all 16
datasets carried, strided output identical to the naive slice. Then the same path as the local run —
`example/00.AnalysisScripts` + `write_hybrid_energy.py` + `plot_ref_style.py`.

**The cluster copy of the analysis pipeline drifts from the repo.** On 2026-08-15 the cluster's
`calc_hdx_ht.py` and `4.calc_D_uptake.py` still lacked the reference subtraction from findings 91, so an
HDX run there would have silently returned uniform MBAR weights. Re-upload the analysis scripts before
trusting any cluster-side result; only the C++ build is kept current by `install.sh`.

**CRITICAL — exchange recirculates a destroyed configuration.** `run_remd.py` reseeds each replica from
`output/pos[-1]`. If that frame is destroyed the next chunk starts destroyed, then an exchange swaps a
healthy configuration in and the bad one moves to another slot. Consequences:

- A single bad configuration appears in many slot files over time (observed walking 3 → 13 → 23 → 33).
- **Per-replica "this file is clean" is meaningless.** Count destroyed configurations *per frame across
  all 48 slots*; the count was 1, then 2, and grew.
- It never self-clears. That is why a detection gate exists.

**Status check:**
```bash
for v in glpG-RKRK-79HIS glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T glpG-RKRK-79ALA glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T; do
  d=~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/$v; f=$(ls -t $d/remd.*.out | head -1)
  echo "$v block=$(cat $d/block_count) nan=$(grep -ic nan $f) DESTROYED=$(grep -c DESTROYED $f)"
done
```

---

## 5. How to check health CORRECTLY

**`isfinite` is not a health check.** At a real glpG failure the environment coordinates were
**±4.65e12 Å** — numerically finite, physically destroyed. And in a forced NP tear the protein reached
**431 broken bonds with the potential still finite at +3e5**, so no energy-based test fires at all.

Use the broken-bond **count** (healthy 0–2; torn 279–431 — a two-order-of-magnitude gap):

```python
import h5py, numpy as np
def n_broken(up, group="output", frame=-1):
    with h5py.File(up, "r") as h:
        pos = np.asarray(h[group]["pos"][frame, 0])
        if not np.isfinite(pos).all(): return -1          # -1 => non-finite
        nm  = np.array([x.decode() for x in h["/input/atom_names"][:]])
        pc  = np.array([x.decode() for x in h["/input/particle_class"][:]])
        rid = h["/input/residue_ids"][:]
    prot = np.where(pc == "PROTEIN")[0]
    C = {int(rid[a]): a for a in prot if nm[a] == "C"}
    N = {int(rid[a]): a for a in prot if nm[a] == "N"}
    res = [r for r in sorted(C) if (r+1) in N]
    cn = np.linalg.norm(pos[[C[r] for r in res]] - pos[[N[r+1] for r in res]], axis=1)
    return int((cn > 2.0).sum())
```

Cheap whole-chunk scan (glpG failures go fully NaN, so the scalar potential catches them):
```python
v = np.asarray(h[group]["potential"][:]).reshape(-1);  bad = int((~np.isfinite(v)).sum())
```
Also useful: protein Rg, and `avg_kinetic_energy/1.5kT` at the end of a log (healthy ≈ 1.0).

---

## 6. The detection gate and rollback (what "DESTROYED" / "ROLLBACK" in a log means)

- NP `health()`: non-finite positions OR `n_stretched >= NP_CN_COUNT` (5) → **ends the chain**
- glpG `destroyed()`: non-finite potential anywhere in the chunk OR `n_stretched >= REMD_CN_COUNT` (5) → **rolls back that replica** (as of 2026-08-12 driver)

**NP**: a gate trip looks like `[np] DESTROYED ...` followed by `no resubmit`; job exits rc=0/COMPLETED
short of its wall limit. A COMPLETED job that did not resubmit means the gate fired — check the log.

**glpG (updated driver)**: a rollback looks like `[remd] ROLLBACK #N filename: reason` followed by
`rolled back M/48 replicas; continuing chain`. The chain does NOT terminate. The NaN output is rotated
to `output_previous_N` as normal history; the rolled-back replica restarts the next chunk from its
pre-chunk positions. A replica that repeatedly blows up gets rolled back repeatedly; it does not get
dropped from the ladder. Watch for high rollback counts on the same file — that indicates a replica with
a persistent physics problem that won't self-correct.

**Rollback mechanism**: before each chunk `run_remd.py` snapshots `/input/pos` (3.6 MB total for 48
replicas). On NaN detection it overwrites the last `output/pos` frame and `output/potential[-1]` with
the pre-chunk values so that `reseed()` on the next iteration picks up the clean state.

**These driver scripts are NOT in git.** They live on the cluster at
`~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/run_remd.py` and `~/project/NP-1AO6/run_np_prod.py`.
No version history exists for them. Edit directly on the cluster.
A running job keeps the version it loaded at start; edits take effect at the **next block**.

---

## 7. If the chain terminates — manual rollback procedure

**glpG (old driver, or gate fired before rollback logic):** patch last output frame of each NaN file
with the last finite frame from `output_previous_0` (end of block 1), then resubmit.

```python
import h5py, numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
run_dir = Path("~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/<variant>").expanduser()
for fn in sorted(run_dir.glob("*.run.*.up")):
    with h5py.File(str(fn), "r") as h5:
        n_bad = int((~np.isfinite(np.asarray(h5["/output/potential"][:]))).sum())
        has_prev = "output_previous_0" in h5
    if n_bad:
        with h5py.File(str(fn), "r+") as h5:
            prev_pos = np.asarray(h5["/output_previous_0/pos"][-1, 0, :, :])
            last = h5["/output/pos"].shape[0] - 1
            h5["/output/pos"][last, 0, :, :] = prev_pos
            h5["/output/potential"][last, 0] = 0.0
# then: bash ~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/submit_remd.sh <variant>
```

**NP**: `run_np_prod.py` `reseed()` is idempotent, so a config with no `/output` but a valid
`/input/mom` (`restart_valid=1`) restarts fine. To reset a chain: `echo 0 > prod/block_count`, `rm -f prod/STOP`.

## 8. Known lessons (environment)

- **NP dt hard limit: 0.001.** dt=0.005 caused backbone blow-ups during unfolding (large-amplitude spring instability at t>250, proven by A/B). Never raise above 0.001.
- **Do not transfer thresholds between NP and glpG.** A CN_MAX borrowed from NP false-positived on a healthy glpG chunk (2.52 Å vs healthy max 2.659 Å) and cost a 6 h block. The two jobs have different physics.
- **glpG NaN propagation via REMD exchange.** A single blow-up in one replica spreads to all 48 via exchange within ~60 steps (IEEE 754: `NaN < 0.f` = false). The NaN cascade fix (`!isfinite(lboltz_diff)`) and the per-chunk rollback driver address this.
- **A green exit code means nothing** for a self-submitting REMD job. Check the log for DESTROYED/ROLLBACK counts and verify physical observables.
- **Midway3 home quota**: 28.6 G of 30 G. Jobs can fail oddly if home fills.
- **Do not run scripts from `/tmp`** on the login node (another user's `/tmp/inspect.py` shadows stdlib).
- **glpG-DDM micelle campaign (closed 2026-08-13).** All four variants failed at block 2–3; used a constant `--seed` causing rollback to re-run the identical failing chunk deterministically. MBAR fix (findings 91) also required before that data was usable. HDX ΔG results in `~/Downloads/glpG_DDM_micelle_HDX_dG/`.
