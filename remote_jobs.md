# Remote jobs on midway2/midway3 — status and handbook

Snapshot: **2026-09-04 ~15:30 CDT (gly-sym training job 48974804 PENDING on midway2 broadwl; three ConDiv.py bugs fixed this session — see gly-sym section).**
Written so a fresh session can pick up cold. Everything needed to connect, check health correctly,
and react to a failure is here. Job state below is live; superseded jobs are not listed, only
summarised in §8 where they carry a lesson.

## 0. Connect first (needs a Duo push on the user's phone)

Key-based auth is NOT enabled; password + Duo is the only method. The ControlMaster socket expires
roughly hourly, so expect to redo this most sessions.

**midway2** (POPE/POPG REMD campaign):
```bash
ssh -S ~/.ssh/cm-mdw2.sock -O check yinhanw@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu   # alive?
expect /Users/yinhan/Documents/upside2-md/scratchpad/mdw2_master.exp    # if not: USER MUST APPROVE DUO
ssh -S ~/.ssh/cm-mdw2.sock yinhanw@midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu '<command>'
```
`~/project` on midway2 is a symlink to `/project/trsosnic` (not `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/`).
Data is at `~/project/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2/`.
Python env: `source /software/modules/init/bash && module load python/3.9.18 hdf5/1.14.3+oneapi-2023.1 && export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE`

**midway3** (NP campaign and glpG-DDM micelle):
```bash
ssh -S ~/.ssh/cm-mdw3.sock -O check yinhanw@midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu   # alive?
expect /Users/yinhan/Documents/upside2-md/scratchpad/mdw3_master.exp    # if not: USER MUST APPROVE DUO
ssh -S ~/.ssh/cm-mdw3.sock yinhanw@midway3.rcc.uchicago.edu '<command>'
```
`~/project` on midway3 is a symlink to `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/` (note: **yinhan**, not yinhanw).
Load the python env with `source ~/project/NP-1AO6/env.sh` before any h5py work.

### midway2 — gly-sym core FF training

| JobID | Name | Cluster | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 48974804 | `upside-gly-sym` | midway2 broadwl | PENDING (Resources) | 2 nodes, 12 tasks × 4 CPUs. Checkpoint: `training/gly-sym/run_output/initial_checkpoint.pkl`. Log: `training/gly-sym/upside-gly-sym_48974804.out`. |

**GLY symmetry fix (complete as of 2026-09-04):** GLY Ramachandran maps are now symmetrized at the source: `parameters/common/rama.dat` (and the training copy `training/gly-sym/upside_input/rama.dat`) have had the `(phi, psi) -> (-phi, -psi)` symmetry applied to all GLY dimer entries (coil index 8, sheet index 7). Max residual asymmetry is 0.0 (was 6.3 E_up). The `upside_config.py` runtime patch has been removed (reverted to master). Training workers call `upside_config.py` at each step, which now reads the symmetric library automatically.

**CWD fix:** `srun_mdw2.sh` now `cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"` before running ConDiv; the checkpoint stores relative paths from the project root.

**Init (2026-09-04 11:13):** pack_param converged to loss=54.1821 (palindrome floor). 38 minibatches × 12 proteins = 456 proteins. GLY dp1 forced palindromic by `rotamer_parameter_estimation.py`.

**Three ConDiv.py bugs fixed 2026-09-04 (all in `training/gly-sym/ConDiv.py`):**
1. `--slurmd-debug=0` in the srun worker launch is restricted to root/SlurmUser on midway2 Slurm. Removed.
2. `shutil.copy` does not set the execute bit on the copied `run_output/ConDiv.py`. Workers launched by srun with just `worker_path` got `execve() Permission denied`. Fixed by passing `sys.executable, worker_path` (same pattern as the non-Slurm branch).
3. `compute_divergence` referenced `nonlinear_coupling_environment` but `upside_config.py`'s `--environment-potential-type` defaults to `1` (sigmoid), writing `sigmoid_coupling_environment` instead. Fixed by renaming the node reference in `compute_divergence`.

**Submit rule:** always submit gly-sym (and all other training/simulation jobs) through the **midway2 SSH socket**. Submitting via the midway3 socket routes to caslake even when the sbatch script requests broadwl.

**Resubmit:** `cd ~/project/yinhan/upside2-md-mdw2/training/gly-sym && sbatch srun_mdw2.sh training/gly-sym/run_output/<latest_checkpoint.pkl> 200`

Note: checkpoint path must be relative to PROJECT_ROOT (the repo root), not to the gly-sym directory, because srun_mdw2.sh does `cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"` before running ConDiv.

### midway2 — POPE/POPG REMD (correct seeds, all 6 GLY fixed)

| JobID | Name | Cluster | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 48973026 | `glpG-RKRK-79HIS` | midway2 | PENDING (Resources) | Resubmitted 14:00 after the 48971711 requeue loop was fixed. `ExcNodeList=midway2-0003`, `block_count` reset 6 to 0. |
| 48971712 | `glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1/12, 2 chunks done, 1 rollback (run.27) |
| 48971713 | `glpG-RKRK-79ALA` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1/12, 2 chunks done, 1 rollback (run.26) |
| 48971714 | `glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T` | midway2 | RUNNING | block 1/12, 2 chunks done, 1 rollback (run.27) |
| 48970780 | `np_1AO6_prod` | midway2 | RUNNING | 8.5 h, Restarts=0, 6 replicas all T=0.86. Log `NP-1AO6/prod/np.48970780.out`. **The NP campaign now runs on midway2, not midway3.** |

**Health measured 2026-09-03 13:45** (not inferred from exit codes):
* Protein is live, not frozen: `potential[:,0]` std = 58 to 621 across recent groups (frozen signature is 0.000).
* glpG Rg = 17.9 to 22.0 Å across all 28 replicas of all 4 variants; hbonds 85 to 202. Physically sane.
* No `nan`/`inf`/error lines in any of the 5 logs.
* **Top of the ladder is straining.** Positive `protein_potential` excursions (vs ~-1400 typical) are
  confined to replicas 26 (T=0.89) and 27 (T=0.90): 68 to 156 such frames per variant, peaking at
  +2905 with hbonds down to 88. These are the same replicas that trip the peptide-bond ROLLBACK
  (`final-frame N of 209 peptide bonds > 2.0 A`). Consistent with the known dt-too-large / LJ-core
  instability at the hot end, not with a healthy ladder. Do not widen the rollback gate; the gate is
  reporting a real event.
* **NP Rg is far above native albumin (about 27 to 30 Å)**: run0 64.9, run1 95.3, run2 72.4, run3 118.4,
  run4 48.9, run5 44.5 Å, and all six grew over the block. Same unphysical expansion flagged before
  (previous peak 230.9 Å). NP footprint conclusions remain unsupported until this is explained.

**79HIS requeue loop, fixed 2026-09-03 14:00.** Job 48971711 was requeued 5 times, every time
`NODE_FAIL` on `midway2-0003`, which `scontrol show node` reports as `ALLOCATED+NOT_RESPONDING`
(a hung node that slurmctld kept re-allocating). It completed zero chunks across 4.5 h.

What was wrong and what was done:
* **The dead node kept being reselected.** `--exclude=midway2-0003` added to `submit_remd.sh`, so it
  propagates to every self-resubmission of all four variants (backup: `submit_remd.sh.bak_pre_exclude`).
* **Node failures were burning the block budget.** `block_count` is a plain file in the run dir that
  `run_remd.py` increments at *every process start*, not per completed chunk, so 6 dead starts had
  advanced 79HIS to 6/12 of `MAX_BLOCKS` with nothing to show. Reset to 0, putting it level with its
  siblings. **Any future NODE_FAIL requeue needs the same reset, or the chain silently ends early.**
* **Verified safe before resubmitting**: `midway2-0003` was `NOT_RESPONDING`, which can also mean a
  network partition with the process still writing. Confirmed no writer was active (log and h5 mtimes
  and log size unchanged over 75 s) and that all 28 replica files open with finite `input/pos`. The
  killed chunk's unflushed HDF5 buffers were discarded, so each file sits at its last consistent
  post-calibration state and `reseed()` continues cleanly from there.
* Left alone: `sc_env_transition_step_start` is 18000 for 79HIS against 39096-40618 for its siblings.
  That counter tracks cumulative simulated steps and correctly reflects that 79HIS has run far fewer,
  so it is consistent, not corrupt. It does undercount slightly, because a requeue does not set
  `REMD_LAST_CHUNK_STEPS` and `reseed()` then credits the default 2000 steps rather than the steps the
  killed chunk actually ran. Not hand-patched: editing that attr is a physics-schedule change.

**Seeds corrected 2026-09-03**: Restored `bak_broken_gly` seeds (properly equilibrated, `activation_stage=production`, `current_stage=production`, has `output` group), applied GLY symmetrization to all 6 helical residues (GLY49, GLY104, GLY128, GLY133, GLY156, GLY180), and expanded box Z from 123.7 Å to 180 Å (updated `martini_potential.z_len` in all 4 seeds). Old replica files deleted; block_count reset.

**VTF extraction note**: `output_previous_0` in each replica is the old seed's `output` group (single-T stage-7 data), moved there by `reseed()`. Skip it; REMD data starts at `output_previous_1`. Script: `/home/yinhanw/project/yinhan/extract_glpg_vtf.py` (skips block 0, wraps atoms into box, unwraps protein backbone chain).

28 replicas per variant (midway2 REMD uses 28-core nodes). Data: `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2/<variant>/`.
Logs: `.../logs/remd.<V>.<jobid>.out`. Self-submitting via `bash submit_remd.sh $V`.

**CRITICAL — rigid-stage fix 2026-09-02**: Seeds were built with `current_stage = minimization` and
`preprod_protein_mode = rigid_body`. The `set_stage_label(seed, "production")` step was never applied,
so all prior trajectory data (output_previous_0 through output_previous_13 for 79HIS; similar blocks for
other variants) was produced with a completely frozen protein: `rama_map_potential std = 0.000` across all
frames. Fixed by `fix_stage.py`: patched `input/stage_parameters.current_stage` to `production` in all
116 files (4 seeds + 28 replicas × 4 variants), reset `block_count` to 0.
Seed backups: `seeds/<V>.up.bak_rigid_stage`.

**DATA EXCLUSION**: All trajectory data produced before 2026-09-02 (output_previous_* groups) in
`popepopg_REMD_mdw2/` has a rigid protein and must NOT be used for any conformational analysis or HDX.

**Verify fix after first chunk** (compare `rama_map_potential std` to NP control = 0.773):
```python
import h5py, numpy as np, os
os.environ["HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING"] = "FALSE"
with h5py.File("/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2/glpG-RKRK-79HIS/glpG-RKRK-79HIS.run.0.up", "r") as h:
    for grp in sorted([k for k in h if k.startswith("output_previous_")], key=lambda k: int(k.split("_")[-1])):
        pot = h[grp]["potential"][:, 0]
        print(f"{grp}: rama_std={np.std(pot):.3f}")
```

Seeds: rebuilt from `hybrid_prep/` MARTINI structures using the corrected `upside_config.py`. Installed to
`/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2/seeds/<V>.up` (old seeds backed up as `.bak_alphaL_restart_2026-09-01`).
Protein is in alphaR (phi_std ≈ -60°, confirmed by BioPython). All 6 helical GLY sym_err=0.000000.
Cluster upside_config.py also patched at `/project/trsosnic/yinhan/upside2-md-mdw2/py/upside_config.py` (backup: `.bak_phi_criterion`).

**GLY map fix 2026-09-01 (complete)**: `inject_backbone_nodes` had a phi convention bug — it uses
a reversed-b0 `_input_phi` formula (phi_up = phi_std ± 180°) but compared against `(-150,-20)` which
captures alphaL GLY, not alphaR. All 6 helical GLY residues (GLY49, GLY104, GLY128, GLY133, GLY156,
GLY180) were never symmetrized during setup. Their maps were biased against alphaR by +0.65–1.65 E_up,
progressively destabilizing alphaR TM helices (manifests as H-bond loss at bilayer midplane — Bug 2).
Fix: `py/upside_config.py` criterion `(-150 <= phi <= -20)` → `(30 <= phi <= 160)` in both
`write_rama_map_pot` and `write_rama_map_pot2`.

**Before resubmitting again, ALWAYS verify seeds:**
```bash
source /software/modules/init/bash
module load python/3.9.18 hdf5/1.14.3+oneapi-2023.1
export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE
cd /project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2
python3 check_seeds_current.py   # must show sym_err < 0.001 for all 6 helical GLY
```

### midway3 (caslake) — context notes

**NP GLY fix 2026-09-01**: 1AO6 albumin had 4 broken helical GLY maps: GLY11, GLY81, GLY203, GLY244
(sym_err 3.0–5.3 E_up, alphaR bias +1.1 to +1.8 E_up). Prior job 56987370 cancelled.
Fixed all 6 seed files with the same periodic-mirror symmetrization as the glpG fix.
Backups at `prod/np.run.*.up.bak_broken_gly`. Check script: `~/project/NP-1AO6/check_np_gly.py`.

**HDX jobs (57041866-69, 57033313-16) — CANCELLED / DONE.** Data they analysed came from the broken
runs with biased GLY49/GLY133 maps. Do not use those HDX results. Rerun HDX after the new REMD
(57068431-34) accumulates sufficient data.

**sbatch fixed 2026-08-31.** RCC resolved the slurmctld spool issue. NP job self-submitted successfully as 56565841. REMD jobs will chain normally once they start. Tmux session `remd_popg` on midway3-login1 may still hold srun processes for REMD jobs from the workaround period — verify before relaunching if jobs start and immediately fail. REMD logs: `~/project/popepopg_REMD/logs/remd.srun.<V>.<jobid>.out`.

**REMD local bypass completed 2026-08-28/29.** Jobs 55758021-24 had been PENDING (Priority queue) since 2026-08-27. Cancelled all 4. Ran block 1 locally on Mac M1 Pro (finished 2026-08-29 ~02:12 EDT); extracted last-frame positions (~10 MB); uploaded and reconstructed 48 × 4 minimal `.up` files on cluster with `cluster_setup.py`. All 192 replica files verified 48/48 per variant with `block_count=1`.

**REMD clean restart 2026-08-27.** Cancelled pending jobs 55118057/55119260/55122401/55122658. Deleted wrong-map trajectory data (57-76 chunks generated with biased G136 Ramachandran map, ~228 GB freed). Reset `block_count` to 0 in all 4 variant dirs. Fresh REMD jobs 55758021-24 will reinitialize 48 replicas from `seeds/` at startup; seeds were patched correctly on 2026-08-21 with the original stride-4 code.


**CRITICAL — post-fix trajectories do NOT reproduce the paper's claims.** Block-2 measurement (2026-08-19, 18 246 frames, 3.2% adsorbed-and-compact):

| Paper claim (Carlson et al.) | Post-fix block 2 | Status |
|---|---|---|
| K190 is the most protected site (water + TES common site) | 0.000 contact — lowest of all 58 Lys | **CONTRADICTS paper** |
| K525 protected (water) | 0.000 contact | Contradicts paper |
| K541 protected (TES) | 0.033 contact | Contradicts paper |
| K12, K73 also protected | 0.000, 0.005 | Contradicts paper |
| "Opens and exposes its center" | Dominant patch: Lys313/Glu311/Asp314/Asp562/Lys560 (max 0.33) | Inconsistent |

Rg reaches 230.9 Å (run.3, block 3) — well past the paper's DPD-simulation range. No `np_footprint.npz` exists yet for the current block-3 trajectories (~231k frames/run). None of the paper's five target lysines are contacted; the footprint must be rerun after block 3 completes before drawing any updated conclusions.

**NaN cascade fix** is deployed in the running binary (`src/main.cpp:~517`, added `!isfinite(lboltz_diff)` to exchange rejection). **GLY Ramachandran stride bug** fixed 2026-08-27 (stride-4 restored, all 192 active replica maps patched). Both are in the current deployed binary; no action needed.

**Verify real dynamics after any stage-label or seed change:** internal CA RMSD (Kabsch-superposed) should grow across frames. A frozen protein gives 0.000–0.001 Å; a live one reaches 1.4 Å within 100 frames. Reading `current_stage` is not sufficient — measure the RMSD.

**`HDX_LIVE=1` is mandatory while the REMD jobs run.** `run_remd.py` renames `output` to the lowest free
`output_previous_<n>` at every chunk, so the live group can vanish between being listed and being read; the
flag makes `martini_remd_concat.py` skip it, at a cost of ~200 of 5043 frames.

### The rigid-protein bug — fixed 2026-08-17, keep the lesson (findings 116)

`/input/stage_parameters.current_stage` was **`production_handoff`** in the four seeds, and
`martini_hybrid.cpp:637-641` holds the protein as a rigid group whenever `preprod_protein_mode == rigid_body`
**and** the stage is not exactly `production`. Both were true, so 28–30 h × 4 ran with a frozen protein:
internal CA RMSD **0.000 Å** across whole chunks, H-bond count constant to ±0.01, identical at every rung.

**Fixed.** `set_stage_label(seed, "production")` on all four (backups at `seeds/<V>.up.bak_production_handoff`),
verified `production` / `production` / `rigid_body`, relaunched as 53441123–26.

**The lesson, which is why this stays here.** The 2026-08-15 note declaring these jobs healthy checked
`hybrid_interface_active_stage` (lines 644-648), which *does* accept `production_handoff`. That is a different
predicate on the same string with the opposite accept set. One string, two gates. Reading a gate is not
verification — measure the protein's internal CA RMSD instead.


**Confirmed loading on the new binary 2026-08-15 00:53**: all four reached `[remd] block 1/12` and
`calibration 2000 steps x 48` with `n_atom 4949`, no `expected 1 arguments but got 2`. The seed migration
held.

**These four were verified rather than resubmitted (2026-08-15).** The BB proxy now reads its backbone O
from `infer_H_O`, so `martini_hybrid_position` takes two arguments and every config written by the older
prep fails to load. Checked, in order: `env.sh` points `UPSIDE_HOME` at the rebuilt
`~/beagle3/yinhan/upside2-md`; the four seeds were upgraded in place with
`py/martini_upgrade_hybrid_args.py` and one was proved to load and run on the new binary; the variant
directories are empty, so `run_remd.py` materialises replicas from those upgraded seeds and there are no
stale copies and no `STOP` files; the seeds carry an `/output`, which the first-block `reseed()` requires;
their stage is `production_handoff`, which `martini_hybrid.cpp:646-647` treats as active, so the SC-env
interface is on — **this line is the error findings 116 corrected; that gate is not the one that decides
whether the protein moves.** The 36 h `REMD_WALL_SEC` equals the Slurm limit but the chunk loop guards with
`remaining() - MARGIN > last_wall*1.25` (35 min plus a chunk), so the chain still has room to reseed and
resubmit. **No resubmission needed.**

The NP job cannot be patched the same way — it holds its six replicas open for the whole block — so
`np_prod.sbatch` now runs the same upgrade in the gap before `upside` reopens them. **Confirmed working
2026-08-15 00:25**: the block rolled over to 53372760, all six reported `upgraded`, and the block then
loaded every config under the new binary. That line is a one-shot migration — delete it once a block
reports "already upgraded".

**Reading a `.up` that a running job owns.** `run_np_prod.py` reseeds by renaming `output` to the lowest
free `output_previous_<n>`, so on a live file that group can vanish between being listed and being read;
a first footprint attempt died on exactly that (`KeyError: object 'output' doesn't exist`). Rotated blocks
are never renamed again, so an analysis should read only `output_previous_*` and skip the live group —
that costs ~1.4% of frames and removes the race. Set `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE` to open at all, and
never let `upside_engine` touch a live file: it opens read-write.

Launcher `popepopg_REMD/{submit_remd.sh,remd.sbatch,run_remd.py,env.sh}`, seeds in `popepopg_REMD/seeds/`,
logs `popepopg_REMD/logs/remd.<jobid>.out`, data `popepopg_REMD/<variant>/`. Seeds are the stage-7.0
checkpoints from `popepopg_glpG/<variant>/checkpoints/`: 4709 atoms (1050 protein / 3393 lipid = 261×13 /
266 ions), box 99.869² × 123.697 Å, 7.48 M pairs, ions regenerated at 0.15 M with
`--membrane-thickness-angstrom 42.75`. This copy of `run_remd.py` uses a **per-chunk RNG seed**; the DDM
copy passes a constant one, which is what made its rollback re-run the identical failing chunk.

Seeds: stage-7.0 checkpoints from `popepopg_glpG/<variant>/checkpoints/`: 4709 atoms (1050 protein / 3393 lipid / 266 ions), box 99.869² × 123.697 Å. `run_remd.py` uses a **per-chunk RNG seed** (DDM copy used constant seed → rollback re-ran the identical failing chunk; now fixed).

## 2. THE TWO CAMPAIGNS ARE DIFFERENT SIMULATIONS

Conflating them caused several errors this session, including a threshold copied from NP that killed a
healthy 6 h glpG block. **Never transfer settings, thresholds, or analysis between them.**

| | **NP** (`np_1AO6_prod`) | **glpG** (`remd_glpG-*`) |
|---|---|---|
| method | regular MD, 6 independent trajectories, single T=0.8647, no exchange | **REMD**, 48 replicas, T ladder 0.70–0.90, configuration exchange |
| purpose | nanoparticle adsorption footprinting (K190 exposure) | **HDX** protection factors / ΔG |
| system | 1AO6 albumin 578 res + 5 nm MPA-AuNP, 8608 atoms, box 300 Å | glpG 210 res in a DDM micelle, 3156 atoms, box 137 Å |
| composition | PROTEIN 2890 + GOLD 887 + MPA 203 + ION 4628 (K+ 2423 / Cl- 2205, 0.15 M KCl) | PROTEIN 1050 + LIPID 1674 + ION 432 |
| integrator | **pure velocity-Verlet**, no `/input/brownian` | **MIXED**: 2736 atoms (ION+LIPID+630 protein) overdamped **Brownian**; 420 protein atoms velocity-Verlet |
| timestep | **0.001**, freely settable at runtime | **0.009, HARD-LOCKED** by `/input/brownian/numerical_time_step`; `martini_brownian.cpp:100` throws on mismatch. Friction is tuned against it for lipid D=11.5 µm²/s — **do not change it** |
| detection | non-finite positions OR ≥5 stretched bonds | non-finite potential (whole chunk) OR ≥5 stretched bonds |

---

## 3. NP campaign — `np_1AO6_prod`

**Unfolding is the expected result, not a failure.** 1AO6 albumin spreads on the MPA-AuNP surface. Rising Rg (currently up to 230.9 Å on run.3, block 3) is the intended observable and must **not** be reported as a blow-up. Judge health on non-finite frames, peptide C–N bonds, and `avg_kinetic_energy/1.5kT`. (Contrast glpG, where Rg ~19 Å is the health signal.)

**Dir** `~/project/NP-1AO6/` — `prod/` holds `np.run.{0..5}.up` + `np.<jobid>.out`, `block_count`. **Current configs are the envfull+300Å rebuild** (protein-protein terms injected, 4628 ions at 0.15 M KCl, 8608 atoms); block_count reset to 0.
**Driver** `run_np_prod.py` · **sbatch** `np_prod.sbatch` (sets `NP_DT=0.001`) · **submit** `submit_np.sh`
**Footprint analysis** `np_footprint.py` → `np_footprint.npz` (must be run; no current npz for block-3 data).
**Orientation map** (cardinal Euler faces; see `scratchpad/NP-footprinting/orientation_map.txt`):

```
np.run.0 = 0-0-0   (yaw=0.0,  pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.1 = 90-0-0  (yaw=90.0, pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.2 = 180-0-0 (yaw=180.0,pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.3 = 270-0-0 (yaw=270.0,pitch=0.0,  roll=0)
np.run.4 = 0-90-0  (yaw=0.0,  pitch=90.0, roll=0)
np.run.5 = 0-270-0 (yaw=0.0,  pitch=270.0,roll=0)
```

Self-resubmits up to `NP_MAX_BLOCKS=8`; chunks ~104 time units, ~1765 t.u. per 36 h block.
Local build source: `scratchpad/NP-footprinting/` (`build_all.py`, `np_hybrid.py`, six face dirs).

## 4. glpG campaign — `remd_glpG-*` (HDX)

**Dir** `~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/` — one subdir per variant, each with 48 `*.run.N.up`,
`remd.<jobid>.out`, `block_count`.
**NOTE the directory name**: `glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD`. The older `glpG_DDM_REMD` (lamellar, 72 G) is gone.
**Driver** `run_remd.py` · **sbatch** `remd.sbatch` · **submit** `submit_remd.sh <variant>`
**Variants:** `glpG-RKRK-79HIS`, `glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T`, `glpG-RKRK-79ALA`, `glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T`

Config: 48 replicas, T 0.70–0.90, `REMD_DT=0.009`, `--replica-interval 0.09`, `--exchange-criterion 0`,
swap sets A=(0-1,2-3,…) B=(1-2,3-4,…), 300 frames/chunk, `REMD_MAX_BLOCKS=12`.

### HDX analysis for the POPE/POPG campaign — RUNNING (submitted 2026-09-01)

Jobs 57033313–57033316, reading from midway2 block-1 data (`popepopg_REMD_mdw2/`, ~7000–7400 frames/replica, `HDX_LIVE=1`). Outputs land in `popepopg_REMD_mdw2/<variant>/hdx/`. Plot: `results/<V>_POPEPOPG_dG_vs_residue.png`.

To resubmit after more data:
```bash
B=/home/yinhanw/project/popepopg_REMD; MDW2=/project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2
for V in glpG-RKRK-79HIS glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T glpG-RKRK-79ALA glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T; do
  sbatch --job-name=hdx_${V} --output=$B/logs/hdx.%j.out --partition=caslake --account=pi-trsosnic \
    --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=16 --time=04:00:00 \
    --export=ALL,PDB_ID=${V},HDX_SRC=${MDW2}/${V},HDX_LIVE=1,HDX_WORK=${MDW2}/${V}/hdx \
    $B/hdx_cluster.sbatch
done
```

It runs `py/martini_remd_concat.py` first — **required**, because the chained driver rotates `output` to
`output_previous_<n>` every chunk, so `/output` alone is just the last ~300 frames. The concat joins the
chunks in restart order, renumbers `time`, and drops whole any chunk with a non-finite potential (a
rolled-back chunk is not a sample). Verified against a 3-chunk file: boundary frames in place, all 16
datasets carried, strided output identical to the naive slice. Then the same path as the local run —
`example/00.AnalysisScripts` + `write_hybrid_energy.py` + `plot_ref_style.py`.

**The cluster copy of the analysis pipeline drifts from the repo.** On 2026-08-15 the cluster's
`calc_hdx_ht.py` and `4.calc_D_uptake.py` still lacked the reference subtraction from findings 91, so an
HDX run there would have silently returned uniform MBAR weights. Re-upload the analysis scripts before
trusting any cluster-side result; only the C++ build is kept current by `install.sh`.

**CRITICAL — exchange recirculates a destroyed configuration.** `run_remd.py` reseeds each replica from
`output/pos[-1]`. If that frame is destroyed the next chunk starts destroyed, then an exchange swaps a
healthy configuration in and the bad one moves to another slot. Consequences:

- A single bad configuration appears in many slot files over time (observed walking 3 → 13 → 23 → 33).
- **Per-replica "this file is clean" is meaningless.** Count destroyed configurations *per frame across
  all 48 slots*; the count was 1, then 2, and grew.
- It never self-clears. That is why a detection gate exists.

**Status check:**
```bash
for v in glpG-RKRK-79HIS glpG-RKRK-79HIS_S115T glpG-RKRK-79ALA glpG-RKRK-79ALA_S115T; do
  d=~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/$v; f=$(ls -t $d/remd.*.out | head -1)
  echo "$v block=$(cat $d/block_count) nan=$(grep -ic nan $f) DESTROYED=$(grep -c DESTROYED $f)"
done
```

## 5. How to check TM helix health (TM1 and TM4)

This check is run frequently after any seed change or after the first trajectory chunk completes.
TM1 (GLY49 at C-cap) and TM4 (GLY133 at N-cap) are the two helices most sensitive to the GLY
Ramachandran bias bug and must be verified independently from the global health check.

### Step 1 — verify seeds before submitting (run once per seed generation)

```bash
cd /project/trsosnic/yinhan/popepopg_REMD_mdw2
module load python/3.11.9
export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE
python3 check_seeds_current.py
```

Expected output for a healthy seed (all 6 helical GLY, sym_err=0):
```
glpG-RKRK-79HIS:
  GLY49:  phi=-94.1  aR=0.965 aL=0.965 sym_err=0.000000  OK
  GLY104: phi=-88.6  aR=1.012 aL=1.012 sym_err=0.000000  OK
  GLY128: phi=-80.0  aR=1.581 aL=1.581 sym_err=0.000000  OK
  GLY133: phi=-141.6 aR=1.121 aL=1.121 sym_err=0.000000  OK
  GLY156: phi=-69.6  aR=1.300 aL=1.300 sym_err=0.000000  OK
  GLY180: phi=-68.5  aR=1.194 aL=1.194 sym_err=0.000000  OK
All seeds OK.
```

A broken seed shows `sym_err ~ 3–6` and `aL < aR`. **Do not submit if any seed shows BROKEN.**

**Current state (2026-09-01)**: Seeds rebuilt from `hybrid_prep/` MARTINI structures using corrected
upside_config.py. Protein is in alphaR (BioPython phi_std ≈ -60° for TM1 body). All 6 helical GLY
maps symmetric. helix_fraction using phi_std ∈ [-130,-20] should be nonzero from the start.

**WARNING — dihedral sign error in the VTF analysis script above**: the homemade `dihedral()` function
returns `-phi_std`. For alphaR residues (true phi_std ≈ -60°), it reports ≈ +60°. Use BioPython's
`calc_dihedral` for any phi verification instead of the function defined above.

### Step 2 — check helix health from a VTF trajectory (after first chunk)

Extract a VTF for the T=0.70 replica (slot 0) and analyse phi/psi:

```python
import numpy as np, re

def parse_vtf(vtf_path):
    """Return atoms list and positions array from a VTF trajectory."""
    atoms = []
    with open(vtf_path) as f:
        for line in f:
            m = re.match(r"atom\s+(\d+)\s+name\s+(\S+)\s+resid\s+(\d+).*chain\s+(\S+)", line)
            if m:
                atoms.append({"aid": int(m.group(1)), "name": m.group(2),
                               "resid": int(m.group(3)), "chain": m.group(4)})
            elif line.startswith("timestep"):
                break
    n_atoms = max(a["aid"] for a in atoms) + 1
    frames = []
    pos = np.zeros((n_atoms, 3)); count = 0; in_frame = False
    with open(vtf_path) as f:
        for line in f:
            if line.startswith("timestep"):
                if in_frame: frames.append(pos.copy())
                pos[:] = 0; count = 0; in_frame = True; continue
            if in_frame:
                if line.startswith(("pbc","bond","atom","#")) or not line.strip(): continue
                parts = line.split()
                if len(parts) >= 3:
                    try: pos[count] = [float(x) for x in parts[:3]]; count += 1
                    except ValueError: pass
    if in_frame and count > 0: frames.append(pos.copy())
    return atoms, np.array(frames)

def dihedral(a, b, c, d):
    b1=b-a; b2=c-b; b3=d-c
    n1=np.cross(b1,b2); n2=np.cross(b2,b3)
    l1=np.linalg.norm(n1); l2=np.linalg.norm(n2)
    if l1<1e-10 or l2<1e-10: return np.nan
    n1/=l1; n2/=l2
    m1=np.cross(n1,b2/np.linalg.norm(b2))
    return np.degrees(np.arctan2(np.dot(m1,n2),np.dot(n1,n2)))

def helix_fraction(atoms, frames, chain="A", res_range=(131, 152)):
    """Fraction of frames where res_range is helical (phi in [-130,-20] AND psi in [-90,15])."""
    n_by_r  = {a["resid"]: a["aid"] for a in atoms if a["chain"]==chain and a["name"]=="N"}

    res_list = [r for r in range(res_range[0], res_range[1]+1)
                if r in n_by_r and r in ca_by_r and r in c_by_r]
    hel_frac = {}
    for r in res_list:
        phis = []; psis = []
        for pos in frames:
            if r-1 not in c_by_r: phis.append(np.nan); psis.append(np.nan); continue
            phi = dihedral(pos[c_by_r[r-1]], pos[n_by_r[r]], pos[ca_by_r[r]], pos[c_by_r[r]])
            psi = dihedral(pos[n_by_r[r]], pos[ca_by_r[r]], pos[c_by_r[r]],
                           pos[n_by_r[r+1]] if r+1 in n_by_r else pos[c_by_r[r]]) if r+1 in n_by_r else np.nan
            phis.append(phi); psis.append(psi)
        phis = np.array(phis); psis = np.array(psis)
        hel_frac[r] = float(np.mean(
            (-130<=phis) & (phis<=-20) & (-90<=psis) & (psis<=15)))
    return hel_frac

# Usage:
atoms, frames = parse_vtf("/path/to/glpG_79HIS_T0.70_slot0.vtf")
# TM4 health (residues 131-152, GLY133 at N-cap)
tm4 = helix_fraction(atoms, frames, res_range=(131, 152))
print("TM4 helix fraction per residue:", {r: f"{v:.2f}" for r, v in tm4.items()})
print("TM4 mean:", np.mean(list(tm4.values())))
# TM1 health (residues 29-49, GLY49 at C-cap)
tm1 = helix_fraction(atoms, frames, res_range=(29, 49))
print("TM1 mean:", np.mean(list(tm1.values())))
# GLY133 phi distribution
# expect: mostly in [-130, -20] for a stable TM4 N-cap
```

**Pass criteria (TM helix healthy):**
- TM4 mean helix fraction > 0.8 across residues 131–152
- TM1 mean helix fraction > 0.8 across residues 29–49
- GLY49 phi stays in [-130°, -20°] for >80% of frames
- GLY133 phi stays in [-150°, -20°] for >80% of frames

**Fail signal (biased maps still active):**
- TM helix fraction near 0 — the helix collapsed
- GLY49 or GLY133 phi drifting to +60° (alphaL) — the map is pushing it left-handed

## 5b. How to check health CORRECTLY (general bond/energy check)

**`isfinite` is not a health check.** At a real glpG failure the environment coordinates were
**±4.65e12 Å** — numerically finite, physically destroyed. And in a forced NP tear the protein reached
**431 broken bonds with the potential still finite at +3e5**, so no energy-based test fires at all.

Use the broken-bond **count** (healthy 0–2; torn 279–431 — a two-order-of-magnitude gap):

```python
import h5py, numpy as np
def n_broken(up, group="output", frame=-1):
    with h5py.File(up, "r") as h:
        pos = np.asarray(h[group]["pos"][frame, 0])
        if not np.isfinite(pos).all(): return -1          # -1 => non-finite
        nm  = np.array([x.decode() for x in h["/input/atom_names"][:]])
        pc  = np.array([x.decode() for x in h["/input/particle_class"][:]])
        rid = h["/input/residue_ids"][:]
    prot = np.where(pc == "PROTEIN")[0]
    C = {int(rid[a]): a for a in prot if nm[a] == "C"}
    N = {int(rid[a]): a for a in prot if nm[a] == "N"}
    res = [r for r in sorted(C) if (r+1) in N]
    cn = np.linalg.norm(pos[[C[r] for r in res]] - pos[[N[r+1] for r in res]], axis=1)
    return int((cn > 2.0).sum())
```

Cheap whole-chunk scan (glpG failures go fully NaN, so the scalar potential catches them):
```python
v = np.asarray(h[group]["potential"][:]).reshape(-1);  bad = int((~np.isfinite(v)).sum())
```
Also useful: protein Rg, and `avg_kinetic_energy/1.5kT` at the end of a log (healthy ≈ 1.0).

---

## 6. The detection gate and rollback (what "DESTROYED" / "ROLLBACK" in a log means)

- NP `health()`: non-finite positions OR `n_stretched >= NP_CN_COUNT` (5) → **ends the chain**
- glpG `destroyed()`: non-finite potential anywhere in the chunk OR `n_stretched >= REMD_CN_COUNT` (5) → **rolls back that replica** (as of 2026-08-12 driver)

**NP**: a gate trip looks like `[np] DESTROYED ...` followed by `no resubmit`; job exits rc=0/COMPLETED
short of its wall limit. A COMPLETED job that did not resubmit means the gate fired — check the log.

**glpG (updated driver)**: a rollback looks like `[remd] ROLLBACK #N filename: reason` followed by
`rolled back M/48 replicas; continuing chain`. The chain does NOT terminate. The NaN output is rotated
to `output_previous_N` as normal history; the rolled-back replica restarts the next chunk from its
pre-chunk positions. A replica that repeatedly blows up gets rolled back repeatedly; it does not get
dropped from the ladder. Watch for high rollback counts on the same file — that indicates a replica with
a persistent physics problem that won't self-correct.

**Rollback mechanism**: before each chunk `run_remd.py` snapshots `/input/pos` (3.6 MB total for 48
replicas). On NaN detection it overwrites the last `output/pos` frame and `output/potential[-1]` with
the pre-chunk values so that `reseed()` on the next iteration picks up the clean state.

**These driver scripts are NOT in git.** They live on the cluster at
`~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/run_remd.py` and `~/project/NP-1AO6/run_np_prod.py`.
No version history exists for them. Edit directly on the cluster.
A running job keeps the version it loaded at start; edits take effect at the **next block**.

---

## 7. If the chain terminates — manual rollback procedure

**glpG (old driver, or gate fired before rollback logic):** patch last output frame of each NaN file
with the last finite frame from `output_previous_0` (end of block 1), then resubmit.

```python
import h5py, numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
run_dir = Path("~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/<variant>").expanduser()
for fn in sorted(run_dir.glob("*.run.*.up")):
    with h5py.File(str(fn), "r") as h5:
        n_bad = int((~np.isfinite(np.asarray(h5["/output/potential"][:]))).sum())
        has_prev = "output_previous_0" in h5
    if n_bad:
        with h5py.File(str(fn), "r+") as h5:
            prev_pos = np.asarray(h5["/output_previous_0/pos"][-1, 0, :, :])
            last = h5["/output/pos"].shape[0] - 1
            h5["/output/pos"][last, 0, :, :] = prev_pos
            h5["/output/potential"][last, 0] = 0.0
# then: bash ~/project/glpG_DDM_micelle_REMD/submit_remd.sh <variant>
```

**NP**: `run_np_prod.py` `reseed()` is idempotent, so a config with no `/output` but a valid
`/input/mom` (`restart_valid=1`) restarts fine. To reset a chain: `echo 0 > prod/block_count`, `rm -f prod/STOP`.

---

## 8. Known lessons (environment)

- **NP dt hard limit: 0.001.** dt=0.005 caused backbone blow-ups during unfolding (large-amplitude spring instability at t>250, proven by A/B). Never raise above 0.001.
- **Do not transfer thresholds between NP and glpG.** A CN_MAX borrowed from NP false-positived on a healthy glpG chunk (2.52 Å vs healthy max 2.659 Å) and cost a 6 h block. The two jobs have different physics.
- **glpG NaN propagation via REMD exchange.** A single blow-up in one replica spreads to all 48 via exchange within ~60 steps (IEEE 754: `NaN < 0.f` = false). The NaN cascade fix (`!isfinite(lboltz_diff)`) and the per-chunk rollback driver address this.
- **A green exit code means nothing** for a self-submitting REMD job. Check the log for DESTROYED/ROLLBACK counts and verify physical observables.
- **Midway3 home quota**: 28.6 G of 30 G. Jobs can fail oddly if home fills.
- **Do not run scripts from `/tmp`** on the login node (another user's `/tmp/inspect.py` shadows stdlib).
- **glpG-DDM micelle campaign (closed 2026-08-13).** All four variants failed at block 2–3; used a constant `--seed` causing rollback to re-run the identical failing chunk deterministically. MBAR fix (findings 91) also required before that data was usable. HDX ΔG results in `~/Downloads/glpG_DDM_micelle_HDX_dG/`.
